Automating deployment may appear daunting at first; however, you have just demonstrated you can accomplish it. You have transitioned from manually building and deploying to having a process that automates it for you reliably every single time.

Additionally, the same basic workflow can be applied to most any other static site. React App? Vue Project? Svelte Site? The workflow is virtually identical, except for changing the build commands.

Therefore, Go Ahead and Automate! And when things break (because they will break at some point) remember: Read the error logs carefully, look at the Actions Tab, and debug methodically. You Got This.
